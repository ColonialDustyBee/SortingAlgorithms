# SortingAlgorithms (Project Created for CS 301 - Data Structures and Algorithms)

This program aims to examine the speed and efficiency of several sorting algorithms with varying inputs.

There were 3 test cases that were inputted into each algorithm as presented in the 3 .txt files that have random numbers.

This project was worked on with a group of three and my responsibility was to work on the quicksort algorithm and then assemble the algorithms together so that they each worked respectively.

To get this program running, simply download the header and .cpp files and then compile them on your own computer. You will also need to create a .txt file that can be read.
